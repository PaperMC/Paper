Subject: [PATCH] Duplicate UUID Resolve Option

Due to a bug in https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper/commit/2e29af3df05ec0a383f48be549d1c03200756d24
which was added all the way back in March of 2016, it was unknown (potentially not at the time)
that an entity might actually change the seed of the random object.

At some point, EntitySquid did start setting the seed. Due to this shared random, this caused
every entity to use a Random object with a predictable seed.

This has caused entities to potentially generate with the same UUID....

Over the years, servers have had entities disappear, but no sign of trouble
because CraftBukkit removed the log lines indicating that something was wrong.

We have fixed the root issue causing duplicate UUID's, however we now have chunk
files full of entities that have the same UUID as another entity!

When these chunks load, the 2nd entity will not be added to the world correctly.

If that chunk loads in a different order in the future, then it will reverse and the
missing one is now the one added to the world and not the other. This results in very
inconsistent entity behavior.

This change allows you to recover any duplicate entity by generating a new UUID for it.
This also lets you delete them instead if you don't want to risk having new entities added to
the world that you previously did not see.

But for those who are ok with leaving this inconsistent behavior, you may use WARN or NOTHING options.

It is recommended you regenerate the entities, as these were legit entities, and deserve your love.
