Subject: [PATCH] Asynchronous chunk IO and loading

ChunkSerializer needs the new tick lists to be saved (see added todos)

This patch re-adds a file IO thread as well as shoving de-serializing
chunk NBT data onto worker threads. This patch also will shove
chunk data serialization onto the same worker threads when the chunk
is unloaded - this cannot be done for regular saves since that's unsafe.

The file IO Thread

Unlike 1.13 and below, the file IO thread is prioritized - IO tasks can
be reoredered, however they are "stuck" to a world & coordinate.

Scheduling IO tasks works as follows, given a world & coordinate - location:

The IO thread has been designed to ensure that reads and writes appear to
occur synchronously for a given location, however the implementation also
has the unfortunate side-effect of making every write appear as if
they occur without failure.

The IO thread has also been designed to accomodate Mojang's decision to
store chunk data and POI data separately. It can independently schedule
tasks for each.

However threads can wait for writes to complete and check if:
 - The write was overwriten by another scheduler
 - The write failed (however it does not indicate whether it was overwritten by another scheduler)

Scheduling reads:

 - If a write task is in progress, the task is not scheduled and returns the in-progress write data
    This means that readers cannot modify the NBTTagCompound returned and must clone if it they wish to write
 - If a write task is not in progress but a read task is in progress, then the read task is simply chained
    This means that again, readers cannot modify the NBTTagCompound returned

Scheduling writes:

 - If a read task is in progress, ignore the read task and schedule the write
    We cannot complete the read task since we assume it wants old data - not current
 - If a write task is pending, overwrite the write data
    The file IO thread does correctly handle cases where the data is overwritten when it
    is writing data (before completing a task it will check if the data was overwritten and
    will retry).

When the file IO thread executes a task for a location, the it will
execute the read task first (if it exists), then it will execute the
write task. This ensures that, even when scheduling at different
priorities, that reads/writes for a location act synchronously.

The downside of the file IO thread is that write failure can only be
indicated to the scheduling thread if:

- No other thread decides to schedule another write for the location
concurrently
- The scheduling thread blocks on the write to complete (however the
current implementation can be modified to indicate success
asynchronously)

The file io thread can be modified easily to provide indications
of write failure and write overwriting if needed.

The upside of the file IO thread is that if a write failures, then
chunk data is not lost until server restart. This leaves more room
for spurious failure.

Finally, the io thread will indicate to the console when reads
or writes fail - with relevant detail.

Asynchronous chunk data serialization for unloading chunks

When chunks unload they make a call to PlayerChunkMap#saveChunk(IChunkAccess).
Even if I make the IO asynchronous for this call, the data serialization
still hits pretty hard. And given that now the chunk system will
aggressively unload chunks more often (queued immediately at
ticket level 45 or higher), unloads occur more often, and
combined with our changes to the unload queue to make it
significantly more aggresive - chunk unloads can hit pretty hard.
Especially players running around with elytras and fireworks.

For serializing chunk data off main, there are some tasks which cannot be
done asynchronously. Lighting data must be saved beforehand as well as
potentially some tick lists. These are completed before scheduling the
asynchronous save.

However serializing chunk data off of the main thread is still risky.
Even though this patch schedules the save to occur after ALL references
of the chunk are removed from the world, plugins can still technically
access entities inside the chunks. For this, if the serialization task
fails for any reason, it will be re-scheduled to be serialized on the
main thread - with the hopes that the reason it failed was due to a plugin
and not an error with the save code itself. Like vanilla code - if the
serialization fails, the chunk data is lost.

Asynchronous chunk io/loading

Mojang's current implementation for loading chunk data off disk is
to return a CompletableFuture that will be completed by scheduling a
task to be executed on the world's chunk queue (which is only drained
on the main thread). This task will read the IO off disk and it will
apply data conversions & deserialization synchronously. Obviously
all 3 of these operations are expensive however all can be completed
asynchronously instead.

The solution this patch uses is as follows:

0. If an asynchronous chunk save is in progress (see above), wait
for that task to complete. It will use the serialized NBTTagCompound
created by the task. If the task fails to complete, then we would continue
with step 1. If it does not, we skip step 1. (Note: We actually load
POI data no matter what in this case).
1. Schedule an IO task to read chunk & poi data off disk.
2. The IO task will schedule a chunk load task.
3. The chunk load task executes on the async chunk loader threads
and will apply datafixers & de-serialize the chunk into a ProtoChunk
or ProtoChunkExtension.
4. The in progress chunk is then passed on to the world's chunk queue
to complete the ComletableFuture and execute any of the synchronous
tasks required to be executed by the chunk load task (i.e lighting
and some poi tasks).
