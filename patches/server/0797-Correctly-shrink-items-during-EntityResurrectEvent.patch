Subject: [PATCH] Correctly shrink items during EntityResurrectEvent

The EntityResurrectEvent logic is supposed to locate a totem of undying
in any of the interaction slots of the player inventory and then, if the
called EntityResurrectEvent is not cancelled, shrink that item by 1,
usually reducing it to zero.

For this, the logic iterates over the items in the interaction slots and
breaks out the loop if a totem of undying was found.
However, even if no totem of undying was found, the iteration item stack
variable remains as a refernce to the last interaction slot probed.

Plugins uncancelling a EntityResurrectEvent, which is published
pre-cancelled to listeners if no totem of undying could be found,
would hence cause the server logic to shrink completely unrelated items
found in, at the writing of this patch, the players off hand slot.

This patch corrects this behaviour by only shrinking the item if a totem
of undying was found and the event was called uncancelled.
