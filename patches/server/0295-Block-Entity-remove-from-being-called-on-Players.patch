Subject: [PATCH] Block Entity#remove from being called on Players

This doesn't result in the same behavior as other entities and causes
several problems. Anyone ever complain about the "Cannot send chat
message" thing? That's one of the issues this causes, among others.

If a plugin developer can come up with a valid reason to call this on a
Player we will look at limiting the scope of this change. It appears to
be unintentional in the few cases we've seen so far.
