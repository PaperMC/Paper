Subject: [PATCH] Fix Longstanding Broken behavior of PlayerJoinEvent

For years, plugin developers have had to delay many things they do
inside of the PlayerJoinEvent by 1 tick to make it actually work.

This all boiled down to 1 reason why: The event fired before the
player was fully ready and joined to the world!

Additionally, if that player logged out on a vehicle, the event
fired before the vehicle was even loaded, so that plugins had no
access to the vehicle during this event either.

This change finally fixes this issue, fully preparing the player
into the world as a fully ready entity, vehicle included.

There should be no plugins that break because of this change, but might
improve consistency with other plugins instead.

For example, if 2 plugins listens to this event, and the first one
teleported the player in the event, then the 2nd plugin actually
would be getting a valid player!

This was very non deterministic. This change will ensure every plugin
receives a deterministic result, and should no longer require 1 tick
delays anymore.
