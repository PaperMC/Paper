Subject: [PATCH] Check dead flag in isAlive()

If a plugin sets the health of a living entity above 0 after it has already died, the entity will be "revived".
It will behave the exact same as before, except with the internal "dead" flag set, resulting in 2 behavior changes,
A: it's completely invulnerable to all damage
B: it's unable to pickup items

isValid() for these bugged entities will return true, isDead() will return false, despite the dead flag.
This patch checks that the mob isn't dead before saying its alive.

Also, even if the plugin is responsibly checking !isDead() before modifying health, on very rare circumstances
I am currently unable to replicate, these "revived" entities can still appear
