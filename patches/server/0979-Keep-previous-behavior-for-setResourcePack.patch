Subject: [PATCH] Keep previous behavior for setResourcePack

Before multiple packs were allowed, setResourcePack
resulted in the client's existing server pack being
replaced. To keep this behavior, we will remove all
packs before sending the new pack. Other API exists
for adding a new pack to the existing packs on a client.
