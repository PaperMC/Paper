Subject: [PATCH] Maps shouldn't load chunks

Previously maps would load all chunks in a certain radius depending on
 their scale when trying to update their content. This would result in
 main thread chunk loads when they weren't really necessary, especially
 on low view distances or "slow" async chunk loads after teleports or
 other prioritisation.

 This changes it to only try to render already loaded chunks based on
 the assumption that the chunks around the player will get loaded
 eventually anyways and that maps will get checked for update every
 five ticks that movement occur in anyways.
