Subject: [PATCH] Disable Explicit Network Manager Flushing

This seems completely pointless, as packet dispatch uses .writeAndFlush.

Things seem to work fine without explicit flushing, but incase issues arise,
provide a System property to re-enable it using improved logic of doing the
flushing on the netty event loop, so it won't do the flush on the main thread.

Renable flushing by passing -Dpaper.explicit-flush=true
