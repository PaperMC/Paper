Subject: [PATCH] Add CrafterCraftEvent

Ports the currently proposed CrafterCraftEvent
from upstream.
The type is experimental to account for spigot
potentially changing some api contracts, however
the event is required for a stable release and
waiting on spigot's PR queue is not an option.

See: https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT/repos/bukkit/pull-requests/1044/overview
