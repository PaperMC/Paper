Subject: [PATCH] Add Entity hidden by default API

This patch adds API that allows entities to be hidden by default. Entities that are hidden by
default are not shown to players until Player#showEntity is invoked on said entity. The same is
true for players that join the server after an Entity is hidden by default.

Hiding entities by default also respects precedent of keeping entities hidden when other plugins
explicitly hide them from a player. If an entity is hidden by default and by a plugin, the entity
must have the plugin that hid them from a player show them in order to be shown to a player again.
If no plugin had previously hidden the entity before the entity was hidden by default, then any
plugin that attempts to show the entity to a player will succeed in doing so.
