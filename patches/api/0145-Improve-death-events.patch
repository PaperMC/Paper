Subject: [PATCH] Improve death events

This adds the ability to cancel the death events and to modify the sound
an entity makes when dying. (In cases were no sound should it will be
called with shouldPlaySound set to false allowing unsilencing of silent
entities)

It makes handling of entity deaths a lot nicer as you no longer need
to listen on the damage event and calculate if the entity dies yourself
to cancel the death which has the benefit of also receiving the dropped
items and experience which is otherwise only properly possible by using
internal code.
