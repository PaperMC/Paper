Subject: [PATCH] PreSpawnerSpawnEvent

This adds a separate event before an entity is spawned by a spawner
which contains the location of the spawner too similarly to how the
SpawnerSpawnEvent gets called instead of the CreatureSpawnEvent for
spawners.

Dropped as it does not apply due to the earlier PreCreatureSpawnEvent patch not being applied
