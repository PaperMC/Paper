+/**
+ * Called when two entities mate and the mating process results in a fertilization.
+ * Fertilization differs from normal breeding, as represented by the {@link org.bukkit.event.entity.EntityBreedEvent}, as
+ * it does not result in the immediate creation of the child entity in the world.
+ * <p>
+ * An example of this would be:
+ * <ul>
+ * <li>A frog being marked as "is_pregnant" and laying {@link org.bukkit.Material#FROGSPAWN} later.</li>
+ * <li>Sniffers producing the {@link org.bukkit.Material#SNIFFER_EGG} item, which needs to be placed before it can begin to hatch.</li>
+ * <li>A turtle being marked with "HasEgg" and laying a {@link org.bukkit.Material#TURTLE_EGG} later.</li>
+ * </ul>
+ *
+ * The event hence only exposes the two parent entities in the fertilization process and cannot provide the child entity, as it will only exist at a later point in time.
