        Before reporting a crash here, please make sure you are on the latest version of Paper.
        Forks of Paper receive no support here. If you are using a fork, please make sure that this crash also happens when using Paper.
        Please do not make reports when the report says "DO NOT REPORT THIS TO PAPER". These are simply messages informing you of lag, to find what is causing it. Ask for tips on Discord or IRC instead.

        Run `/version` on your server and **paste** the full, unmodified output here.
        "latest" is *not* a version; we require the output of `/version` so we can adequately track down the issue.
        Additionally, do NOT provide a screenshot, you MUST paste the entire output.
