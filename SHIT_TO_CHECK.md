# Shit to check

* Mini: "Allow disabling armour stand ticking": Not sure if the equipment update actually works, vanilla shifted a bunch of shit
* Mini: "Optimize World Server Map": Figure out how to fill PaperWorldMap, it needs a dim key which doesnt exist anymore?
* Mini: "MC-50319": fix if still works
* Mini: I definetly dropped a patch I didnt want to drop, we need to go thru in the end and see if all patches are still in, lol
* Make sure the flat bedrock setting doesn't do anything stupid
* Check DataBits foreach
