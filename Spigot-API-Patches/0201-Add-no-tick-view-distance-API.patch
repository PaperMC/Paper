Subject: [PATCH] Add no-tick view distance API

Originally from: https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity/blob/master/patches/api/0003-View-distance-api.patch
Licence: MIT

This allows setting a view distance where entities and chunks as a whole
do not tick. Servers can use this to make it seem as if they have a
higher view distance setting than they truly do.
