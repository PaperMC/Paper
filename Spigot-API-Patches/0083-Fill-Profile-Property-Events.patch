Subject: [PATCH] Fill Profile Property Events

Allows plugins to populate profile properties from local sources to avoid calls out to Mojang API
to fill in textures for example.

If Mojang API does need to be hit, event fire so you can get the results.

This is useful for implementing a ProfileCache for Player Skulls
