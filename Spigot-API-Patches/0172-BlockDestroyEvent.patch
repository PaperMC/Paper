Subject: [PATCH] BlockDestroyEvent

Adds an event for when the server is going to destroy a current block,
potentially causing it to drop. This event can be cancelled to avoid
the block destruction, such as preventing signs from popping when
floating in the air.

This can replace many uses of BlockPhysicsEvent
