Add Timings to LevelTicks and EntityTickList
Check IBlockDataList#GLOBAL_PALETTE
Check if PlayerNaturallySpawnedEvent is called correctly
Make sure fluids aren't completly fucked, there may be more sync loads to nuke there as well
Improve Server Thread Pool and Thread Priorities: mojang added a max thread count property
Use Vanilla Minecart Speeds: is this needed?
Handle Oversized Tile Entities: make sure impl is correct
0467-Optimize-WorldBorder-collision-checks-and-air check first hunk that has been removed
