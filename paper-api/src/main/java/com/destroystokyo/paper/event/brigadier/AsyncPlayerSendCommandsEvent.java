/**
 * Fired any time a Brigadier RootCommandNode is generated for a player to inform the client of commands.
 * You may manipulate this CommandNode to change what the client sees.
 *
 * <p>This event may fire on login, world change, and permission rebuilds, by plugin request, and potentially future means.</p>
 *
 * <p>This event will fire before {@link org.bukkit.event.player.PlayerCommandSendEvent}, so no filtering has been done by
 * other plugins yet.</p>
 *
 * <p>WARNING: This event will potentially (and most likely) fire twice! Once for Async, and once again for Sync.
 * It is important that you check event.isAsynchronous() and event.hasFiredAsync() to ensure you only act once.
 * If for some reason we are unable to send this asynchronously in the future, only the sync method will fire.</p>
 *
 * <p>Your logic should look like this:
 * {@code if (event.isAsynchronous() || !event.hasFiredAsync()) { // do stuff }}</p>
 *
 * <p>If your logic is not safe to run asynchronously, only react to the synchronous version.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is a draft/experimental API and is subject to change.</p>

 * @since 1.20.6
