/**
 * An entity can move between worlds with an arbitrary tick delay, be temporarily removed
 * for players (i.e end credits), be partially removed from world state (i.e inactive but not removed),
 * teleport between ticking regions, teleport between worlds, and even be removed entirely from the server.
 * The uncertainty of an entity's state can make it difficult to schedule tasks without worrying about undefined
 * behaviors resulting from any of the states listed previously.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is designed to eliminate those states by providing an interface to run tasks only when an entity
 * is contained in a world, on the owning thread for the region, and by providing the current Entity object.
 * The scheduler also allows a task to provide a callback, the "retired" callback, that will be invoked
 * if the entity is removed before a task that was scheduled could be executed. The scheduler is also
 * completely thread-safe, allowing tasks to be scheduled from any thread context. The scheduler also indicates
 * properly whether a task was scheduled successfully (i.e scheduler not retired), thus the code scheduling any task
 * knows whether the given callbacks will be invoked eventually or not - which may be critical for off-thread
 * contexts.
 * </p>
