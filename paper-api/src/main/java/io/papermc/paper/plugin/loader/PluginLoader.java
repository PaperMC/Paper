 * A plugin loader is responsible for creating certain aspects of a plugin before it is created.

 * This, as of right now, only applies to creating the expected classpath for the plugin, e.g. supplying external
 * libraries to the plugin.
 * <p>
 * It should be noted that this class will be called from a different classloader, this will cause any static values
 * set in this class/any other classes loaded not to persist when the plugin loads.
