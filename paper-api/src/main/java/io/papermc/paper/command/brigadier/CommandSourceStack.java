/**
 * The command source type for Brigadier commands registered using Paper API.
 * <p>
 * While the general use case for CommandSourceStack is similar to that of {@link CommandSender}, it provides access to
 * important additional context for the command execution.
 * Specifically, commands such as {@literal /execute} may alter the location or executor of the source stack before
 * passing it to another command.
 * <p>The {@link CommandSender} returned by {@link #getSender()} may be a "no-op"
 * instance of {@link CommandSender} in cases where the server either doesn't
 * exist yet, or no specific sender is available. Methods on such a {@link CommandSender}
 * will either have no effect or throw an {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.</p>
