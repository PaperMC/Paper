/**
 * A HelpTopicFactory is used to create custom {@link HelpTopic} objects from
 * commands that inherit from a common base class or have executors that
 * inherit from a common base class. You can use a custom HelpTopic to change
 * the way all the commands in your plugin display in the help. If your plugin
 * implements a complex permissions system, a custom help topic may also be
 * appropriate.
 * <p>
 * To automatically bind your plugin's commands to your custom HelpTopic
 * implementation, first make sure all your commands or executors derive from
 * a custom base class (it doesn't have to do anything). Next implement a
 * custom HelpTopicFactory that accepts your custom command base class and
 * instantiates an instance of your custom HelpTopic from it. Finally,
 * register your HelpTopicFactory against your command base class using the
 * {@link HelpMap#registerHelpTopicFactory(Class, HelpTopicFactory)} method.
 * <p>
 * As the help system iterates over all registered commands to make help
 * topics, it first checks to see if there is a HelpTopicFactory registered
 * for the command's base class. If so, the factory is used to make a help
 * topic rather than a generic help topic. If no factory is found for the
 * command's base class and the command derives from {@link
 * org.bukkit.command.PluginCommand}, then the type of the command's executor
 * is inspected looking for a registered HelpTopicFactory. Finally, if no
 * factory is found, a generic help topic is created for the command.
 *
 * @param <TCommand> The base class for your custom commands.
 * @since 1.1.0
