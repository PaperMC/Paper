     *     order.
     * <li>Any newly registered or unregistered handler is ignored after an
     *     event starts execution.
     * <li>The handlers for this event may block for any length of time.
     * <li>Some implementations may selectively declare a specific event use
     *     as asynchronous. This behavior should be clearly defined.
     * <li>Asynchronous calls are not calculated in the plugin timing system.
