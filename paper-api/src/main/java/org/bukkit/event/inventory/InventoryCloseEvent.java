/**
 * This event is called when a player closes an inventory.
 * <p>
 * Because InventoryCloseEvent occurs within a modification of the Inventory,
 * not all Inventory related methods are safe to use.
 * <p>
 * Methods that change the view a player is looking at should never be invoked
 * by an EventHandler for InventoryCloseEvent using the HumanEntity or
 * InventoryView associated with this event.
 * Examples of these include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link HumanEntity#closeInventory()}
 * <li>{@link HumanEntity#openInventory(org.bukkit.inventory.Inventory)}
 * <li>{@link HumanEntity#openWorkbench(org.bukkit.Location, boolean)}
 * <li>{@link HumanEntity#openEnchanting(org.bukkit.Location, boolean)}
 * <li>{@link InventoryView#close()}
 * </ul>
 * To invoke one of these methods, schedule a task using
 * {@link org.bukkit.scheduler.BukkitScheduler#runTask(org.bukkit.plugin.Plugin, Runnable)}, which will run the task
 * on the next tick. Also be aware that this is not an exhaustive list, and
 * other methods could potentially create issues as well.
