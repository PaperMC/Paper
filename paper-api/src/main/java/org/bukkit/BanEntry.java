 *     <th>Description</th>
 * </tr><tr>
 *     <td>Target Profile / IP Address</td>
 *     <td>The target profile or IP address</td>
 * </tr><tr>
 *     <td>Creation Date</td>
 *     <td>The creation date of the ban</td>
 * </tr><tr>
 *     <td>Source</td>
 *     <td>The source of the ban, such as a player, console, plugin, etc</td>
 * </tr><tr>
 *     <td>Expiration Date</td>

 * changes to the ban list. If this ban entry has expired (such as from an
 * unban) and is no longer found in the list, the {@link #save()} call will
 * re-add it to the list, therefore banning the victim specified.

 * Likewise, changes to the associated {@link BanList} or other entries may or
 * may not be reflected in this entry.
