How To (Server Admins)

Paperclip is a jar file that you can download and run just like a normal jar file.

Download a copy of Paperclip.jar from our buildserver here:
https://ci.destroystokyo.com/job/PaperSpigot/

Run the Paperclip jar directly from your server. Just like old times

Paper requires [**Java 8**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) or above.

How To (Compiling Jar From Source)
------
To compile Paper, you need JDK 8, maven, and an internet connection.

Clone this repo, run `./build.sh --jar` from *bash*, get files.

Leave off --jar if you only wish to resync your checkout and not create a paperclip jar file just yet.
