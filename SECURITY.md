# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We generally only fully support the latest version, the same applies to exploits such as server crashes and item
duplication bugs. In the transition period during larger Minecraft updates, we may still backport important fixes to the
last minor or major release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For any issues that are NOT duplication bugs, server/client crashes, or otherwise serious exploits, please open an issue
through the [Issues tab](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper/issues).
For exploits, please [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/papermc) and see the [#paper-exploit-report channel](https://discord.com/channels/289587909051416579/1208749386348101682) for
further instructions.
