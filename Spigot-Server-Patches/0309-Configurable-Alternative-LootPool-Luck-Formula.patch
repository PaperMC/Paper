Subject: [PATCH] Configurable Alternative LootPool Luck Formula

Rewrites the Vanilla luck application formula so that luck can be
applied to items that do not have any quality defined.

See: https://luckformula.emc.gs for data and details
-----------

The rough summary is:
My goal was that in a pool, when luck was applied, the pool
rebalances so the percentages for bigger items is
lowered and smaller items is boosted.

Do this by boosting and then reducing the weight value,
so that larger numbers are penalized more than smaller numbers.
resulting in a larger reduction of entries for more common
items than the reduction on small weights,
giving smaller weights more of a chance

-----------

This work kind of obsoletes quality, but quality would be useful
for 2 items with same weight that you want luck to impact
in varying directions.

Fishing still falls into that as the weights are closer, so luck
will invalidate junk more.

This change will result in some major changes to fishing formulas.

-----------

I would love to see this change in Vanilla, so Mojang please pull :)
