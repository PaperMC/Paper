Subject: [PATCH] Ensure chunks are always loaded on hard position sets

Player Movement, Entity Creation and Teleportation move
entities with a very "You are here, no debate" change, making
the server register them as there, regardless if that chunk was
loaded or not.

It appears possible that with hack clients and lag, a player
may be able to move fast enough to move into an unloaded
chunk and get into a buggy state.

To prevent this, we will ensure a chunk is always loaded,
guaranteeing that the entity will be properly registered
into its new home comfortably.
