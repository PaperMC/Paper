Subject: [PATCH] Prevent position desync in playerconnection causing tp
 exploit

Caused the server to revert to the player's overworld coordinates
after teleporting into the end.

Sidenote: The underlying issue is that the move call can teleport
entities and do other things like kill the entity. In the future,
to fix all exploits derieved from this usually unexpected
behaviour, we need to move all of this dangerous logic outside
of the move call and into an appropriate place in the tick method.
