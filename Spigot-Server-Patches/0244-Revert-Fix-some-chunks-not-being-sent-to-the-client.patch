Subject: [PATCH] Revert "Fix some chunks not being sent to the client"

This patch actually allows chunks to be sent before lighting has been calculated in a chunk,
causing lighting to be invalid on chunks sent to clients. as lighting is done during chunk
population and the server tracks which chunks have been sent to the client, this is no longer
an issue.

as the server tracks what chunks have and haven't been sent to the client (and the original
issue for this appears to have already been fixed in the server in 1.9), there is nothing
that this patch is actually achieving as of now.
